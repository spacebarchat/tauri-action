# Tauri GitHub Action

This GitHub Action builds your Tauri application as a native binary for macOS, Linux and Windows and optionally upload it to a GitHub Release.

If your project doesn't include a Tauri project, the action can initialize it for you, so if you don't need to use Tauri's API, you can just ship native apps through this Action without making changes to your web app.

## Usage

**_For more workflow examples, check out the [examples](examples) directory._**

This GitHub Action has three main usages: test the build pipeline of your Tauri app, uploading Tauri artifacts to an existing release, and creating a new release with the Tauri artifacts.

This example shows the most common use case for `tauri-action`. The action will build the app, create a GitHub release itself, and upload the app bundles to the newly created release.

This is generally the simplest way to release your Tauri app.

```yml
name: 'publish'

# This will trigger the action on each push to the `release` branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  publish-tauri:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-20.04, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}

## Tips and Caveats

- You can use this Action on a repo that doesn't have Tauri configured. We automatically initialize Tauri before building, and configure it to use your Web artifacts.
  - You can configure the project initialization with the `distPath` and `iconPath` options.
  - If you need to further customize the default `tauri.conf.json` file you can add a custom config that will be merged with the default one at build time.
    - `args: --config custom-config.json`
- You can run custom Tauri CLI scripts with the `tauriScript` option. So instead of running `yarn tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>` or `npm run tauri <COMMAND> <ARGS>`, we'll execute `${tauriScript} <COMMAND> <ARGS>`.
  - Useful when you need custom build functionality when creating Tauri apps e.g. a `desktop:build` script.
  - `tauriScript` can also be an absolute file path pointing to a `tauri-cli` binary. The path currently cannot contain spaces.
- If you want to add additional arguments to the build command, you can use the `args` option. For example, if you're setting a specific target for your build, you can specify `args: --target your-target-arch`.
- When your Tauri app is not in the root of the repo, use the `projectPath` input.
  - Usually it will work without it, but the action will install and use a global `@tauri-apps/cli` installation instead of your project's CLI which can cause issues if you also configured `tauriScript` or if you have multiple `tauri.conf.json` files in your repo.
  - Additionally, relative paths provided via the `--config` flag will be resolved relative to the `projectPath` to match Tauri's behavior.
- If you create the release yourself and provide a `releaseId` but do not set `tagName`, the download url for updater bundles in `latest.json` will point to `releases/latest/download/<bundle>` which can cause issues if your repo contains releases that do not include updater bundles.
- If you only want to build the app without having the action upload any assets, for example if you want to only use [`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact), simply omit `tagName`, `releaseName` and `releaseId`.
